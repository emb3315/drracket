LAMBDA CALCULUS

compiler: a compiler can take something that looks like plain arithmetic and convert it automatically into a format that the computer can execute.

interpreter: an interpreter is similar, although it performs the actions described in a humanwritten program directly; there is no internediate step that converts it all the way down to a computer format.

compilers and interpreters are software.

FORTRAN

ALGOL 60 

Lisp-a family of programming languages

Every open parenthesis is followed by an operator. Left parentheses are open parentheses; right parentheses are closed parentheses.

By adding a quote to the left of a piece of Lisp code, we turn it into a piece of data.

Functions: objects that understand only one message are functions, "run your code on the following arguments"

assignment standards
jumps in control flow

syntactic sugar: shorthand for a bom bination of concepts from this tiny core language

Scheme is a prototyped Lisp language.

PDE program development environment
IDE interactive development environment

Racket has many flavors, beginner languages are called teaching languages. 

Definitions panel: where you record your code, used to define variables and functions
Interactions panel (read-eval-print loop): is for experimenting with expressions

binary search, cutting the number of possibilities in half at each step

keyword: e.g. define

set! = set bang
